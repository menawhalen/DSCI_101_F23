You are playing Dungeons and Dragons. You are an Elf named Steve and you come up against a Orc named Mobrukk Pride Bruiser. You must battle. In order to defeat the Mobrukk you must do the following:

(a) Roll a 6 sided die and call this number n.
(b) You now get n 20 sided dice and you roll all of them.

You defeat the Mobrukk if ANY of the n 20 sided die display a prime number. What is the probability that you defeat Mobrukk? (Run a large number of simulations.)
