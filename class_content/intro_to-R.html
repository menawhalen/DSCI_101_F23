<h1>Intro to R</h1>
<div id="section-what-is-r" class="section level2">
<h2>What is R?</h2>
<p>R is a language and environment for statistical computing and
graphics. Website: <a
href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</a></p>
</div>
<div id="section-pros" class="section level2">
<h2>Pros</h2>
<ul>
<li>R is free.</li>
<li>There are many packages for R. Chances are someone has written it
already.</li>
<li>Many cutting-edge techniques are available very quickly.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-cons" class="section level2">
<h2>Cons</h2>
<ul>
<li>R is free. This means there is no official support for R.</li>
<li>This also means that you use a package at your own risk and you
trust the author wrote the code correctly.</li>
<li>Takes a little while to learn.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-what-is-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>What is Rstudio?</h2>
<p>RStudio? is a free and open-source integrated development environment
(IDE) for R. Website: <a
href="https://www.rstudio.org/">rstudio.org</a></p>
</div>
<div id="section-rstudio-interface" class="section level2">
<h2>RStudio Interface</h2>
<p>The RStudio interface is composed of quadrants, each of which fulfils
a unique purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Console</code> window,</li>
<li>The <code>Source</code> window,</li>
<li>The <code>Environment / History / Connections / Tutorial</code>
window, and</li>
<li>The <code>Files / Plots / Packages / Help / Viewer</code>
window</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes you might only see three windows and wonder where the
Source window has gone in your version of RStudio. In order to use it
you have to either open a file or create a new one. You can create a new
file by selecting <code>File &gt; New File &gt; R Script</code> in the
menu bar, or use the keyboard shortcut <code>Ctrl + Shift + N</code> on
PC and <code>Cmd + Shift + N</code> on Mac.</p>
<div id="section-the-console-window" class="section level3">
<h3>The Console window</h3>
<p>The console is located in the bottom-left, and it is where you often
will find the output of your coding and computations. It is also
possible to write code directly into the console. Let’s try the
following example by calculating the sum of <code>10 + 5</code>. Click
into the console with your mouse, type the calculation into your console
and hit Enter/Return ↵ on your keyboard. The result should be pretty
obvious:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  # We type the below into the console
  10 + 5
#&gt; [1] 15</code></pre>
<div class="float">
<img src="%22console_algebra.png%22" alt="R Consol" />
<div class="figcaption">R Consol</div>
</div>
<p>You just successfully performed your first successful computation. I
know, this is not quite impressive just yet. R is undoubtedly more than
just a giant calculator.</p>
<p>In the top right of the console, you find a symbol that looks like a
broom. This one is quite an important one because it clears your
console. Sometimes the console can become very cluttered and difficult
to read. If you want to remove whatever you computed, you can click the
broom icon and clear the console of all text. I use it so frequently
that I strongly recommend learning the keyboard shortcut, which is
<code>Ctrl + L</code> on PC and Mac.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-source-window" class="section level3">
<h3>The Source window</h3>
<p>In the top left, you can find the source window. The term ‘source’
can be understood as any type of file, e.g. data, programming code,
notes, etc. The source panel can fulfil many functions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Inspect data in an Excel-like format</p></li>
<li><p>Open programming code, e.g. an R Script</p></li>
<li><p>Open other text-based file formats, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plain text (.txt),</p></li>
<li><p>Markdown (.rmd),</p></li>
<li><p>Websites (.html),</p></li>
<li><p>LaTeX (.tex),</p></li>
<li><p>BibTex (.bib),</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Edit scripts with code in it,</p></li>
<li><p>Run the analysis you have written.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the source window will show you whatever file you are
interested in, as long as RStudio can read it - and no, Microsoft Office
Documents are not supported. Another limitation of the source window is
that it can only show text-based files. So opening images, etc. would
not work.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-environment-history-connections-tutorial-window"
class="section level3">
<h3>The Environment / History / Connections / Tutorial window</h3>
<p>The window in the top right shows multiples panes. The first pane is
called Environment and shows you objects which are available for
computation. One of the first objects you will create is your dataset
because, without data, we cannot perform any analysis. Another object
could be a plot showing the number of male and female participants in
your study. Besides datasets and plots, you will also find other objects
here, e.g. lists, vectors and functions you created yourself. Don’t
worry if none of these words makes sense at this point. We will cover
each of them in the upcoming chapters. For now, remember this is a place
where you can find different objects you created.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-files-plots-packages-help-viewer-window"
class="section level3">
<h3>The Files / Plots / Packages / Help / Viewer window</h3>
<p>The last window consists of five essential panes. The first one is
the Files pane. As the name indicates, it lists all the files and
folders in your root directory. A root directory is the default
directory where RStudio saves your files, for example, your analysis.
Thus, the Files pane is an easy way to load data into RStudio and create
folders to keep your research project well organised.</p>
<p>Since the Console cannot reproduce data visualisations, RStudio
offers a way to do this very easily. It is through the Plots pane. This
pane is exclusively designed to show you any plots you have created
using R.</p>
<p>If you wish to delete the plot, you can click on the red circle with
a white x symbol. This will delete the currently visible plot. If you
wish to remove all plots from this pane, you can use the broom. There is
also an option to export your plot and move back and forth between
different plots.</p>
<p>The next pane is called Packages. Packages are additional tools you
can import and use when performing your analysis. A frequent analogy
people use to explain packages is your phone and the apps you install.
Each package you download is equivalent to an app on your phone. It can
enhance different aspects of working in R, such as creating animated
plots, using unique machine learning algorithms, or simply making your
life easier by doing multiple computations with just one single line of
code.</p>
<p>If you are in dire need of help, RStudio provides you with a Help
pane. You can search for specific topics, for example how certain
computations work. The Help pane also has documentation on different
datasets that are included in R, RStudio or R packages you have
installed. If you want a more comprehensive overview of how you can find
help, have a look at CRAN’s <a
href="https://www.r-project.org/help.html">‘Getting Help with R’</a>
webpage.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-customise-your-user-interface" class="section level3">
<h3>Customise your user interface</h3>
<p>As a last remark in this chapter, I would like to make you aware that
you can modify each window. There are three basic adjustments you can
make:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hide panes by clicking on the window symbol in the top right
corner of each window,</p></li>
<li><p>Resize panes by dragging the border of a window horizontally or
vertically, or</p></li>
<li><p>Add and remove panes by going to
<code>RStudio &gt; Preferences &gt; Pane Layout</code>, or use the
keyboard shortcut <code>⌘ + ,</code> if you are on a Mac. Unfortunately,
there is no default shortcut for PC users.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a fully customised experience you can also alter the
colour scheme of RStudio itself
(<code>RStudio &gt; Preferences &gt; Appearance</code>).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-install-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Install Packages</h2>
<p>Many of R’s most useful functions do not come preloaded when you
start R, but reside in packages that can be installed on top of R. R
packages are similar to libraries in C, C++, and Javascript, packages in
Python, and gems in Ruby. An R package bundles together useful
functions, help files, and data sets. You can use these functions within
your own R code once you load the package they live in. Usually the
contents of an R package are all related to a single type of task, which
the package helps solve. R packages will let you take advantage of R’s
most useful features: its large community of package writers (many of
whom are active data scientists) and its prewritten routines for
handling many common (and exotic) data-science tasks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may hear R users (or me) refer to “base R.” What is base R? It is
just the collection of R functions that gets loaded every time you start
R. These functions provide the basics of the language, and you don’t
have to load a package before you can use them.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="section-how-to-install-r-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>How to install R packages</h3>
<p>To use an R package, you must first install it on your computer and
then load it in your current R session. The easiest way to install an R
package is with the install.packages R function. Open R and type the
following into the command line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>install.packages(“<package name>”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will search for the specified package in the collection of
packages hosted on the CRAN site. When R finds the package, it will
download it into a libraries folder on your computer. R can access the
package here in future R sessions without reinstalling it. Anyone can
write an R package and disseminate it as they like; however, almost all
R packages are published through the CRAN website. CRAN tests each R
package before publishing it. This doesn’t eliminate every bug inside a
package, but it does mean that you can trust a package on CRAN to run in
the current version of R on your OS.</p>
<p>You can install multiple packages at once by linking their names with
R’s concatenate function, c. For example, to install the tidyverse,
run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>install.packages(“tidyverse”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this is your first time installing a package, R will prompt you to
choose an online mirror of to install from. Mirrors are listed by
location. Your downloads should be quickest if you select a mirror that
is close to you. If you want to download a new package, try the Austria
mirror first. This is the main CRAN repository, and new packages can
sometimes take a couple of days to make it around to all of the other
mirrors.</p>
<p><img src="https://vimeo.com/203516241" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-loading-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Loading Packages</h3>
<p>Installing a package doesn’t immediately place its functions at your
fingertips. It just places them on your computer. To use an R package,
you next have to load it in your R session with the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>library(“package name”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that the quotation marks have disappeared. You can use them if
you like, but quotation marks are optional for the library command.
(This is not true for the install.packages command).</p>
<p>library will make all of the package’s functions, data sets, and help
files available to you until you close your current R session. The next
time you begin an R session, you’ll have to reload the package with
library if you want to use it, but you won’t have to reinstall it. You
only have to install each package once. After that, a copy of the
package will live in your R library. To see which packages you currently
have in your R library, run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>library()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>library() also shows the path to your actual R library, which is the
folder that contains your R packages. You may notice many packages that
you don’t remember installing. This is because R automatically downloads
a set of useful packages when you first install R.</p>

<div id="section-file-types" class="section level2">
<h2>File Types</h2>
<p>There are many types of files that you will interact with when using
R and Rstudio.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>R Files</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>.R - an R script</li>
<li>.Rmd - an RMarkdown script - incorporates code and texts together to
<em>knit</em> a document together. Knitting an rmd file compiles the
text and code together to create another file such as an .html or
.pdf</li>
<li>.Rproj - an R Project file which works with Rstudio to help you
organize your different coding projects. The working directory will
automatically be set to the directory that the .RProj file is located in
allowing easier organization and access to your data and files.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Data Files</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>.csv - comma seperated values file</li>
<li>.xlxs - excel file</li>
<li>.txt - text file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do yourself</strong> Create a R project for this class with
all the files downloaded for the course.</p>
<p>The code for this is created in an Rmd that turns it into at
<code>Learnr</code> tutorial. This is easy to follow guided practice for
when you are first learning to code.</p>
<p>The next section will start using R and you will see code chunk of R
that you can run on this tutorial but I recommend starting an R script
to follow along with. To do this go to File – New File – R Script.</p>
